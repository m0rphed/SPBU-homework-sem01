Of course, Edward Lear was not the only writer of limericks. This one was written by Anita V:

An infatuated man from Dover,

was left by his imaginary lover.

He pulled his hair,

in sheer despair,

forgetting a wig was his cover.

Another example was written about a Ballerina by Selina Wallis,

There once was a girl Selina,

who wanted to be a ballerina.

She went on her toes,

and broke her nose.

Then she became cleaner.
